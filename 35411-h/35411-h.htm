<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is the night of all nights of the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ghosts and warlocks haunt the troubled earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And disembodied spirits visit us&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spirits of good and evil from the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh from the angel hosts and from the damned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the vast profound betwixt the two;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spirits from living bodies, disenthralled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By blesséd sleep, or yearnings most intense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by more subtle agencies beyond our ken&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing portentious messages to those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in full faith the future would behold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The clear-cut radiance of a frosty moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lights up, and darkens, all the growth around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great trees stand out black against the stars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind in gusts bestirs the Autumn leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose late October tints are lost in gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or are grown pallid with their shivering;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fitful rustlings are the only sounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which break the dead cold silence of the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet hist! faint eerie tones are sometimes heard&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which blanch the cheek and palsy all the limbs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to the moaning of departed souls!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within the farm-house is a large high room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unceiled, but studded thick with rafters old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grown black with age or smoke; around its walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stiff hams and bacon-flitches dimly seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here and there the dim uncertain forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of kitchen-ware and chairs and metal mugs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the low windows, half across the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch bands of moonlight flecked with shadowed leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which tremble till the moonlight seems to dance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the fireplace stands some piled-up wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the great hearthstone opens cold and black;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the inner door, a chink of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems but to make the dimness darker yet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only sound the tick-tack of the clock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which serves to make the silence audible.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High on the hill a lordly pile looks down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From its proud eminence and grand domain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the farm-house in the vale below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Builded of marble, lofty, turretted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It looms beneath the moonlight o'er the trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some etherial castle in the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Limned in white alabaster, glistening, grand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unreal, weird, not made by mortal hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sudden, as one's wrapt gaze takes it in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It turns to gray, then vanishes!<br /></span>
<span class="i13">Yet, no!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis but a sudden cloud athwart the moon.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within the castle, in a sumptuous room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits young Sir Bertram Morven, all alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had been reading that sweet Persian tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him who knocked at the beloved one's door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried: "'Tis I, who loveth thee!" To whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, answering, said: "Thou canst not enter here!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how, a twelvemonth past, he knocked again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the beloved one asking: "Who art thou?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied: "It is thyself," and entered in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dull flames at his feet leap fitfully,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lights and shadows sweep across his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like thoughts of heaven and hell across the soul.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back in Holt's farm-house what a change is there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The raftered room is filled with light and sound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From blackened hearth the joyful flames leap up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roar and crackle through the piled-up logs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On either side the old Holts sit and smile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt them, circled, sit the younger ones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who laugh and chat, until the old man cries:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be silent, children! Let us not forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ancient usage of our family:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feast of Sah'm has come! The sacred fire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fire of Peace&mdash;is kindled on the hearth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Hallowed One, whose warmth is like this fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which giveth joy and comfort to us all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be present with us in the coming storms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bless us and keep us in the coming year!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat the others, joining in: "O Thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all Thy Saints, protect us all the year!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the flames leap and crackle all the more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roar a joyous answer to the prayer.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">After a silence of a little space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thoughts are busy with the by-gone days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The farmer speaks again: "Good wife," says he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We know the Past, with all its ills and joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We need not rake its ashes o'er again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Present finds us hale and hearty yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blest in our children and our steadfast love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who would solve the Future in advance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath yet to learn the lessons of content.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But feasting on contentment is poor fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What say you to some bread and cheese and beer?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, Ada, daughter, bring my long-stemmed pipe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, Hettie, niece, the apples and the nuts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, John, my son, pile up more blazing logs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A chilly tremor through my bones just ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if some enemy walked o'er my grave."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shadowy form, shrouded and hooded, bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With weight of years, and wickedness perchance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creeps slowly towards the glowing window-panes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peers within. She sees the emptied mugs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pipes; the scattered hazel-husks, which tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tale of love-divining; in their chairs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old folks dozing. John and Hettie sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most strangely near together! On the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands Ada, beauteous maiden, all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swaying most gracefully from side to side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With uplift hand and circling apple rind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sudden drops and forms a doubtful B.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blushing face and close-claspt hands, her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softened with yearning hope, are raised to where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moonlight strives to enter.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Holy saints!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is it ails the terror-stricken maid?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She "saw a face glued to the window-pane&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hideous face," she said, "which gibed, and seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mock, and threaten dire calamity&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waving crutch, which beckoned her outside!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Tush, tush! my girl," the 'wakened farmer cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Twas but a fancy. Ho, John, go outside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, but to satisfy her, look around!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John goes, and soon returns; he has "well searched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet searched in vain; no mortal is in sight."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, reassured, the old man's mug is filled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pipe re-lit; more wood piled on the fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as he craves it, Ada sings a song:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">ADA'S SONG.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A noble knight 'mid lordly halls<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dreams all his life away;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lowly maid in cottage walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hard-by the rippling waterfalls,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Permits her heart to stray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">His image mirrored in her heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heaven help thee, lowly maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So near and yet so far apart!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He tells his love. She doth not start,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor move, nor seem afraid!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"A gruesome gulf's between us spread"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She cries&mdash;"Sir Knight, beware!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fate spans that gulf with mystic thread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So frail that only souls may tread&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Impalpable as air!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Like ancient Roc I'll wing my flight"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He whispers&mdash;"O, be mine!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll wing thee to my castle height<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wed thee, sweet!" She answers bright:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Then I, dear love, am thine!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The while she sang with more than human art&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her voice full-throbbing like a bird's&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seemed to see a vision of the knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed to be the maiden of the song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half her heart expressed its love in words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While all her soul beamed from her glorious eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, at the last, her rounded arms, outstretched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to embrace the hero of her song.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While Ada sings, what happens at the hall?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Bertram still sits gazing at the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing strange shapes and embered phantasies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come and depart and come again more strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While his set gaze grows painful, and his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whirls with conflicting conscience and desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he hath seen the beauteous, lovely maid&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loved her from the moment that he saw&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loved her, yet dared not wed, nor whisper love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now he seems to see her in her home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her golden tresses rippling o'er her brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her violet eyes, lit up with love's own light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned full upon himself, O ravishment!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While her full-throated song enthralls his soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O love!" he cries, "Sweet love, be mine indeed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou pearl of beauty! goddess of my heart!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her outstretched arms appear to welcome him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raises his, to clasp her to his breast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo, the vision vanishes! and loud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hoarse tower-bell clangs out the hour of ten!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He rises hastily and treads the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What was it Elpsie croaked, as home he rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That very evening?&mdash;Elpsie, that old hag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What devil had inspired her?&mdash;'Bertram, lad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere cock-crow this All-Hallow-E'en I see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy loved one swoon in thine enamored arms!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then she laughed uncannily and struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her crutch against the lightning-blasted ash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mumbled, 'My revenge is come at last!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could she mean? Impossible, to-night!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet when hath Elpsie prophesied in vain?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart beats fast, his blood begins to surge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head to swim. "More air!" he cries; "more air!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long brisk walk will shake these fancies off!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, the song grown silent at the farm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The egg-charm ended, and the molten-lead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And apple-bobbing done with; now they sit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man snoring while the old dame nods&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young ones telling stories of the Eve:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Janet Smith last Hallow-E'en did see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er her left shoulder, after certain rites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of John Smith, who soon married her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the mirror-test was good, no doubt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the colewort's prophecies were sure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the hemp-seed test was surer still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But best of all, the image in the well!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stories which creep, and breed a shallow laugh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance, with inward shuddering and fear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until a sharp gust shakes the window-panes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in the grip of some strong shiv'ring hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with a start, the old folks wake again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Good man, 'tis long past ten!" the old dame cries.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well, well, good wife, the hours creep on apace&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred fire doth need replenishment&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we grow older, feebler, with the years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon must leave to younger, stronger hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The toils and troubles, and the joys, of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As now we yield to them this vigil strict;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another mug and pipe, and then, to bed!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The "image in the well!" What well? and where?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From farm and castle full a mile away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near to an ancient tree&mdash;a Druid oak&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old well stands&mdash;its waters deep and pure&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its moss-grown stones much worn by age and use.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In olden days&mdash;so runs the legend&mdash;when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good King Arthur and his chosen knights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upheld the right, and lifted womanhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By force of arms to heights almost divine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A recreant knight betrayed a gentle maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she, ashamed to let the thing be known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled from her home, into the forest wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grieved and wept her very soul away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she died&mdash;the tale is often told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the people there believe it true&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the hard earth, beside her, gushed a spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fed, as they say, by all the tears she shed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, on a day when Arthur passed that way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the story sad, he bade be walled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With masonry, "As monument," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To teach all coming time that Mother Earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath more of heart and faith than recreant knight"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And named it "Myra's Well"&mdash;and passed along.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And later, when the false knight rode that way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was beset, dismounted, beaten, stripped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sorely wounded in a fray, and crawled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Myra's Well&mdash;not knowing of the tale&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kneeled to slake his thirst, and bending low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw her reproachful face, and seeing, died!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Scarcely a bow-shot from poor Myra's Well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheltered and hid by woods and undergrowth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A low hut leans against gray-lichened rocks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Elpsie's home&mdash;beshunned by humankind&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which strange stories had been gossiped 'round:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fifty years ago, on Hallow-E'en,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At midnight, in a storm, a wayward youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Losing his way had stumbled on the hut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found it tenanted, and peeping in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld a sad-eyed maiden all alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reclining on a couch hard-by the fire!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he had prayed admittance from the storm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How pity beat the wall of prudence down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how he took advantage of her state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how she cursed him in her crazy shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prayed God blast all issue of his loins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the wrong should be atoned in kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how, as years ran by, though rarely seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sad-eyed maid became a withered hag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And practised witchcraft and foul sorcery.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Alone, for sure, that Farmer Holt had once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near to the graveyard, in the dead of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen by the moonlight, riding on a broom&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight from the castle to the hut beyond&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A form and face like Elpsie's, in the air&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattering on all sides curses as she flew!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A great black pot is simmering o'er a fire,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The matted hair, the parchment-wrinkled skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Elpsie&mdash;elbowing her knees, her jowl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supported like a wedge between her palms&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crouching and swaying feebly back and forth&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How comes Sir Bertram here at such a time?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And has his walk dispelled his phantasies?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the crisp night-air faintly booms a bell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis from the castle. There is Myra's well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eleven o'clock&mdash;and still a mile from home!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is Elpsie's hut! What did she mean?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he notes the dull outpouring light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cranny grows more bright, and larger seems!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What could that mean? A moment more would tell."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he hears the warlock's prophecy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He peers within and sees, or seems to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sweet and sad-eyed maiden all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reclining on a couch hard-by the fire!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rubs his eyes, as dreaming, looks again&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sees an empty couch, dull flickering flames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And toothless Elpsie rocking to and fro!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he remembers, with a start, that once&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, long ago!&mdash;he knows not when nor where&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a dream, distinct and plain as this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which he saw this self-same sad-eyed maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the couch&mdash;and then the toothless hag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after that, beside a moss-grown well&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could that be Myra's?&mdash;kneeling on the curb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her golden hair half-silvered by the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And violet eyes lit up by love divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Ada&mdash;his! And then there came a mist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which blotted from his mem'ry all the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ten thousand limping devils! Could it be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The well had magic power?&mdash;That <span class="smcap">She</span> had heard?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That <span class="smcap">She</span> this night would test it?" Thus thought he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And then Old Elpsie's words&mdash;ne'er known to fail!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all the Saints and Souls I'll wait and see!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From out the rear-door of the Farmer's house&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old folks long since gone, and fast asleep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes pretty Hettie. Once before this Eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went a short space hand-in-hand with John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both blindfold, to pull kail; but now alone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under her arm a bag half full of seed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hemp-seed&mdash;the which at midnight she must sow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, looking back, will see the reaper come&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathering the growing crop&mdash;her future spouse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce is she hid from view, when after her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steps forth sly John, a sickle in his hand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, from the front, steals Ada, trembling one&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half startled at the shadows on the lawn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And takes the bridle-path t'ward Myra's well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind sighs softly through the falling leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she sighs half responsively. The bark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of distant hound sounds strangely near! The low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of far-off cattle seems like near-by groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sends strange shudders through her hurrying frame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rustle of the leaves, or snapping twig,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes her heart beat more quickly than a clock!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hundred times before she sees the well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She clasps her rosary and says a prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wishes she were home again once more&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet hurries all the faster on her way!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once a frightened hare dashed swift across<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her ghostly path, and shook with terror all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her comely limbs! And once she saw two eyes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two piercing eyes that sparkled, 'neath a bush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made her giddy till she signed the cross&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw a great black cat flit fast away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange shapes on either hand she seemed to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which gibed and waved long shadowy arms, and shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long threat'ning fingers at her! Once she thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw, betwixt a tree-top and the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A witches form with Elpsie's face, and heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or thought she heard, harsh maledictions fall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once she slipt, and nearly fell with fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a slimy, moving thing, that crawled!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice she heard the dreaded were-wolf's howl!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice a flame-eyed snake did hiss at her!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice she heard the hooting of an owl!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below, above, on all sides, sharp beset<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With horrid shapes and phantasies and threats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which grew more numerous and portentious still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she came nearer to the sacred well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until her limbs could scarcely bear her form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all her Faith seemed vanishing in fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And courage almost failed expectancy.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last, thank God, the sacred well in sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She kneels some minutes more, to tell her beads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gather breath and strength and that repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fixity of purpose needed for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coming test. Then rising, looking not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To right or left, she comes unto the well&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An open space near by the sacred oak&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kneeling at the curb, with eyes uplift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She addeth to her other prayers these words:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Sainted Myra, sanctified by death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sorrows such as moved both Earth and Heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Sainted Myra, purified through tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which this well bears witness night and day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, O Holy Mother, in whose heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The erring find a wide-souled sympathy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mediate help&mdash;O help me now I pray!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If this be sin, to wish to know the Truth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Truth which fond hearts find within this well&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgive the sin, and save me of thy grace!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her pensive pose, her small claspt-hands, her hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like golden threads in silvery air bestirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty of her angel face, her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit with divine effulgence like twin stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her trustful innocence and faith, would melt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heart of stone to worship at her feet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With outstretched arms and timid touch of curb&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking the time has come&mdash;she forward bends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks down upon the glassy surface then&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she looks, the startled air resounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With clanging bell, which strikes the hour of twelve!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, Holy Mary, spare that lovely maid!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What sees she there? At first the pool seems dark&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cloud perchance swift coursing o'er the moon&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, only dimly visible, <span class="smcap">A SHAPE</span>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as she looks, the shape grows clearer, till<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sees the image of Sir Bertram's face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Bertram! dear Sir Bertram! God be thanked,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cries, "that Bertram will be lord of me!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then she sees TWO faces in the well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her own, and his! An arm steals 'round her waist!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Startled, she turns, and swoons in Bertram's arms!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He holds her close to his impassioned breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissing her hair and eyes and cheeks and mouth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then feels the beating of her fluttering heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prays her to come back to life and him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He chafes her small white hands and dainty limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, from the well, drops water on her brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all in vain&mdash;so cold and still she lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like living beauty sudden smit with death!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fool that I was!" the anxious lover cries&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I have worked harm indeed by coming forth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus oft we hurt the one we love most dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learn too late the folly of an hour!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lifts her gently in his loving arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bears her easily to Elpsie's hut&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Elpsie there&mdash;the door wide open stands!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lays her on the couch, renews the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his bended knee by Ada's side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regards her sadly and adoringly.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soon he perceives a tremor o'er her steal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift fluttering of her breath, a sudden gasp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deep-drawn sigh, and then her eyes unclose&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her violet eyes so tender and so true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet with a far-off-look between the lids&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gaze half mournfully at him. Then soft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And musical her low voice sounds again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My Bertram, mine, methought I had a dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in that dream I lost thee&mdash;thou, my life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet through all that dream, another dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which thou madest me all thine own&mdash;thy wife&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rained soft kisses on my lips and brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And guarded me like Christ and all His Saints,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And held me safely to thy noble breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all of good or ill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">But thou art pale!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on thy face swift shadows come and go!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, kiss me love! The night is cold, not thou!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For warm thy brown cheek is, as flesh and blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I feel thy sweet breath on my brow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are spirits all as palpable as thou?"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then&mdash;half startled by the sudden doubt&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where am I, Bertram?"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"Here upon my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou best-beloved, secure and safe with him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is thyself from henceforth and for aye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether for good or ill&mdash;but surely good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, in old Elpsie's hut, near-by the well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At which I found thee, and didst bring thee here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frightened by sudden seeing of a face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That looked the love it owns!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">"O holy Saints!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O shame! what have I done?" poor Ada cries:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It all comes back with harrowing circumstance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! to curse my mem'ry; woe is me!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here broke down with sudden storm of tears&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tears and sighs!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"Nay, nay, dear heart"&mdash;he chides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clasps her close&mdash;"The churchmen hold it true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all which rightly ends is justified.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I always loved thee, sweet, from the first day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dared not wed&mdash;nor even woo a bride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A curse is on our house. When yet a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Elpsie told me how ancestral sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had brought it down from father unto son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thence to me. My grandsire died, unshriven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his own hand, 'tis said, beside this well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his children died quite suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By deaths almost as strange; and I alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am left&mdash;the last one of the line! Dare I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring misery and death to her I love&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I love thee?"<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"Thou lovest me, Sir Knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lowly maiden, in a forest lone?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! honest love would make no chaffer thus!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hintest what thy proud lips dare not say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dallying like wanton bee about a flower!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath honor fled from man?"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"Nay, nay, mine own&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banish distrust and fear! The hand of fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is in our meeting&mdash;none, save she, to blame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a moment in each being's life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which that being's destiny doth hang&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment fateful and all-pivotal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For both of us that moment now has come!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the head of God a nimbus floats&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the divine effulgence of His Truth!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all His Saints do borrow of that light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even men do share its guiding beams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ask thy hand in wedlock, lovely maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou wilt brave the curse with me."<br /></span>
<span class="i13">"The curse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand curses would I risk with thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thy leal wife! To such a Knight as thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Bertram&mdash;my true Knight&mdash;no ill shall fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, should it come, then let it fall on me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Heaven is kind, and Mary merciful&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sir Bertram built a chapel on its site;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The home of Morven the "Great Mountain," who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gone "down to the vale" to meet his love&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"By moonlight," in "mid-watches of the night,"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sir Bertram and his Lady with their sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And daughters&mdash;and the Holts at times, with theirs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For John and Hettie now were parents too&mdash;<br /></span>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
